                <td>Fault Tolerant</td>
                <ul>A system that is designed to continue functioning even if one or more components of the system fail.
                    In the context of networking, this might mean having redundant hardware or network paths to ensure
                    that if one component fails, another can take over without causing disruption to the network</ul>
                <td>Redundant</td>
                <ul>the use of extra components or connections that provide backup or alternate routes in case of
                    failure. This might include redundant network cables, switches, or servers, as well as multiple

                <td>Cybersecurity</td>
                <td>Malware</td>
                <ul>A general term used to describe any type of malicious software designed to harm a computer system or
                    steal information. Malware can include viruses, worms, trojan horses, spyware, and more.</ul>
                <td>Virus</td>
                <ul>A type of malware that is designed to spread from one computer to another by attaching itself to
                    executable files or documents. When a user opens the infected file, the virus is activated and can
                    cause harm to the system, such as deleting files or stealing information.</ul>
                <td>worm</td>
                <ul>Similar to a virus, a worm is a type of malware that is designed to spread across a network or the
                    internet by exploiting vulnerabilities in computer systems. Unlike viruses, worms can spread without
                    the need for a user to open an infected file.</ul>
                <td>Trojan Horse</td>
                <ul>A type of malware that is disguised as legitimate software or files. When the user downloads or
                    installs the software, the Trojan horse can execute its malicious code and perform actions such as
                    stealing data or taking control of the system.</ul>
                <td>Spyware</td>
                <ul>A type of malware that is designed to gather information about a user's activities on a computer or
                    network, typically without the user's knowledge or consent. This can include capturing keystrokes,
                    recording browsing history, or monitoring emails.</ul>
                <td>Phishing</td>
                <ul> A social engineering technique used to trick users into providing sensitive information such as
                    passwords, credit card numbers, or personal information. Phishing attacks typically involve sending
                    fraudulent emails or creating fake websites that resemble legitimate ones.</ul>
                <td>DDoS Attack</td>
                <ul>A type of cyberattack in which a large number of requests or data packets are sent to a server or
                    network, overwhelming its capacity and causing it to crash or become unavailable. DDoS attacks can
                    be carried out using botnets or other networks of compromised computers, and are often used to
                    extort money or disrupt services.</ul>

                <td>Protection</td>
                <td>Firewall</td>
                <ul>A hardware or software-based security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing

                    access to a network by blocking malicious traffic.</ul>
                <td>Spam Filter</td>
                <ul>A program or service that is designed to identify and block unwanted or unsolicited emails, commonly
                    referred to as spam. Spam filters use a variety of techniques to identify and block spam, including
                    analyzing the content of emails, examining sender information, and checking against blacklists of
                    known spammers.</ul>
                <td>Proxy Server</td>
                <ul>A server that acts as an intermediary between a client device and the internet. Proxy servers can be
                    used to hide the IP address of the client device, as well as filter or block traffic based on
                    predetermined rules.</ul>
                <td>Antivirus Software</td>
                <ul>A program designed to detect, prevent, and remove malicious software, such as viruses, worms, and

                </ul>
                <td>Cryptography</td>
                <ul>The practice of securing information by transforming it into an unreadable format using mathematical
                    algorithms. Cryptography is used to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data in
                    transit and at rest.</ul>
                <td>Public Key Encryption</td>
                <ul>A method of cryptography that uses a pair of keys, one public and one private, to encrypt and
                    decrypt data. The public key can be shared with anyone, while the private key is kept secret. Public
                    key encryption is commonly used in online transactions and to secure communications over the
                    internet.</ul>
